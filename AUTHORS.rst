WaTEM/SEDEM was initially developed at KU Leuven, by members of the current Geography
and Tourism Research Division of the Department Earth and Environmental Sciences,
formerly the Laboratory for Experimental Geomorphology.

Main developers were Gerard Govers, Kristof Van Oost (now at UC Louvain),
Anton Van Rompaey en Gert Verstraeten.
The code has been further adjusted by Marijn Van Den Broeck and Jeroen Degerickx
and several students.

Since 2017, updates to the Free Pascal code and the maintenance of
the Github WaTEM/SEDEM site is now mostly done by `Fluves <www.fluves.com>`_,
funded by two organisations of the
Flemish Government:

- `Departement Omgeving <https://omgeving.vlaanderen.be>`_
- `Vlaamse Milieu Maatschappij (VMM) <https://www.vmm.be/>`_

The contributors of Fluves, Departement Omgeving and VMM are Johan Van de Wauw, Daan Renders,
Sacha Gobeyn, Niels De Vleeschouwer, Stijn Van Hoey and Jarne Amerlinck, Dries Luts,
Seth Callewaert and Bashar Al-Barri. The supervision and coordination of the developments is done by
Petra Deproost (Departement Omgeving) and Nele Van Ransbeeck (VMM).
Model developments by Fluves are scientifically supported by KU Leuven.
