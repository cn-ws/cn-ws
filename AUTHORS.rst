WaTEM/SEDEM was initially developed at KU Leuven, by members of the current Geography
and Tourism Research Division of the Department Earth and Environmental Sciences,
formerly the Laboratory for Experimental Geomorphology.

Main developers were Gerard Govers, Kristof Van Oost (now at UC Louvain),
Anton Van Rompaey en Gert Verstraeten.
The code has been further adjusted by Marijn Van Den Broeck and Jeroen Degerickx
and several students.

When using WaTEM/SEDEM, reference should be provided to the current model code on github
and to the following publications:

- Van Oost K, Govers G, & Desmet PJJ, 2000. Evaluating the effects of changes in
  landscape structure on soil erosion by water and tillage. Landscape Ecology 15 (6),
  579-591.
- Van Rompaey A, Verstraeten G, Van Oost K, Govers G & Poesen J, 2001. Modelling mean
  annual sediment yield using a distributed approach. Earth Surface Processes and
  Landforms 26 (11), 1221-1236.
- Verstraeten G, Van Oost K, Van Rompaey A, Poesen J & Govers G, 2002. Evaluating an
  integrated approach to catchment management to reduce soil loss and sediment pollution
  through modelling. Soil Use and Management, 18, 386-394.

Intellectual property rights remain at KU Leuven.

Updates to the Free Pascal code and the maintenance of the Github WaTEM/SEDEM site is
now mostly done at `Fluves <www.fluves.com>`_, funded by two organisations of the
Flemish Government:


- `Departement Omgeving <https://omgeving.vlaanderen.be>`_
- `Vlaamse Milieu Maatschappij <https://www.vmm.be/>`_
