<p>The flow and sediment routing is based on a multiple flow direction
algorithm implemented on a fixed grid. Specifically, the algorithm
makes use of the height profile and class of land cover to define the flow
from a source pixel to one or two target pixel(s).</p>
<p>The flow routing varies as a function of the difference in height between
the source and <strong>potential</strong> target pixels, and the <strong>land cover</strong> class of
the source and targets. In addition, it varies as a function of presence of
conductive dams, conductive ditches and buffers (and forced routing, see
<a class="reference internal" href="routing-extension.html#routing-extensions"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>). The land cover is defined in the following table
(see also <a class="reference internal" href="input.html#prcmap"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>). The codes (pixel id) listed in this table are
used to define the routing in WaTEM/SEDEM. An important distinction is made between
the land cover of (a) target(s) being equal to the class <cite>river</cite> (-1) and not
being equal to the class <cite>river</cite> (non-river pixels). Do note that in this
manual the non-river pixels are sometimes referred to as <cite>land pixels</cite>.</p>

<h2>Flow scheme of the routing algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#flow-scheme-of-the-routing-algorithm" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>In this section we will describe the routing algorithm in depth, with several
flow charts as an illustration.</p>
<p>The first step of the routing algorithm is to sort all pixels in the raster from
high to low, based on the <a class="reference internal" href="input.html#dtmmap"><span class="std std-ref">digital elevation model</span></a>. In the
next step, the algorithm loops over all pixels, starting from the highest
pixel:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>If the pixel is a <strong>land pixel</strong>, the default routing algorithm is used. If
the user enables the <a class="reference internal" href="model_extensions.html#forcerouting"><span class="std std-ref">Forced Routing</span></a>-option in the
ini-file, the calculation of the routing by the default routing algorithm
is altered on user-defined pixels. Thus, for these pixels, the
user-defined routing will overrule the rulebank of the routing algorithm.
This is an extension (see <a class="reference internal" href="routing-extension.html#forcedrouting-extension"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>)</p></li>
<li><p>If the pixel is a <strong>river pixel</strong> and the river routing option is enabled
(see <a class="reference internal" href="model_extensions.html#riverrouting"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>), the algorithm will use the user-defined
routing in the rivers. If the pixel is a river pixel and the river routing
is not enabled, than no river routing is calculated. This is an extension
(see <a class="reference internal" href="model_extensions.html#riverrouting"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>)</p></li>
<li><p>If the landcover of a pixel has a value of 0, it is skipped and no routing
is calculated for this pixel.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="one-and-two-target-routing">
<h2>One- and two-target routing<a class="headerlink" href="#one-and-two-target-routing" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Routing over land pixels can be defined as two- (cardinal directions)
or one-target (ordinal and cardinal directions) routing.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Two targets: routing is defined by one or two targets as a function of the
direction, this only in the <strong>cardinal direction</strong>, thus only considering
<strong>four cardinal pixels</strong>. Flows and sediment loads are distributed
according to the angle between the direction (float number between 0 and
360 degrees) and the cardinal axes
(see <a class="reference internal" href="#twotarget"><span class="std std-ref">section two target routing</span></a>). This
direction is determined by the digital elevation model (and if relevant the
tillage direction).</p></li>
<li><p>One target: routing is defined by one routing vector, and can be in the
<strong>cardinal</strong> and <strong>ordinal direction</strong>, thus <strong>eight adjacent pixels</strong>.
One-target routing is based on a
decision tree (see figure <a class="reference internal" href="#onetarget"><span class="std std-ref">section one-target routing</span></a>)
using land cover and the digital elevation
model. The starting point for one-target routing is the two-target routing.</p></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Two-target routing is computed first based on the digital elevation model
(and the tillage direction, extension). This two-target routing can still be
changed to one-target routing based on the land cover of the targets (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#onetarget"><span class="std std-ref">section one-target routing</span></a>). Note that the digital
elevation information is still used in the one-target routing scheme
(in case of jumps).</p>
<div class="section" id="two-target-routing">
<span id="twotarget"></span><h3>Two-target routing<a class="headerlink" href="#two-target-routing" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>If the routing is not determined by a buffer, conductive ditch, conductive
buffer dam or a river, the routing algorithm checks whether the flow direction
vector <strong>D</strong> is steered by the steepest descent direction (or the
<strong>tillage direction</strong>, see <a class="reference internal" href="input.html#tildirmap"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>). The cardinal directions
define the <cite>target1</cite> and <cite>target2</cite> pixels, and the weight
(<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\in[0,1], \sum \text{weight} = 1\)</span>) they receive from the source
pixel. This amount can be used to weigh the sediment load per pixel
(WaTEM/SEDEM), the direct run-off depth (Curve Number) and upstream area
(WaTEM/SEDEM &amp; Curve Number) for each target pixel (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#twotarget"><span class="std std-ref">next section</span></a>).</p>
<p>In the figure below it is shown how the two targets are determined by the
routing direction vector <strong>D</strong>. The routing direction (determined by the height
profile and - if included - the tillage direction) is first split in two
cardinal directions (<strong>T1</strong> and <strong>T2</strong>). Depending on the quadrant the
direction points to, index shifts are defined for the raster, with one pixel
in the x-direction (columns in rasters) and y-direction (rows in rasters)
(see also table below). The index shifts are used to define the two target
pixels. The amount of flow and sediment load that is routed to each of the two
targets is calculated by computing the angle between the cardinal direction of
the targets with the direction vector <strong>D</strong> (determined by height profile
and -if included- the tillage direction).</p>

<p>One-target routing is determined by the digital elevation model and the land
cover of the two target pixels determined in the section above. The flow
directions and weights (cardinal space) are adjusted according to elevation
and land cover, as shown in the scheme below. Do note that in this procedure
two-target routing is adjusted to one-target routing. Cardinal directions
are maintained in this transformation, except for jump routing. By considering
jumps, a wider range of pixels are considered. As a consequence, the direction
is not solely defined by the cardinal and ordinal direction for jumps.</p>

jumps. By considering jumps, a wider range of pixels are considered.
As a consequence, the direction is not solely defined by the cardinal and
ordinal direction for jumps.</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this image"></a></p>
</div>
<p>In this figure, the <cite>Flow(target1)</cite> or <cite>Flow(target2)</cite> tag indicate that
routing will follow strictly the path of the first or second flow
direction. The <cite>find_lower</cite> tag indicates that the algorithm will
search for the lowest neighbouring pixel: this functionality is used to
indicate if a single target (cardinal and ordinal directions) is used instead of
two targets (cardinal direction). A <cite>jump</cite> indicates
the target is not a adjacent pixel of the source: the routing jumps
to a single target further than its eights adjacent pixels.  Jumps are
defined within a window <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W\)</span>. This occurs when a source is located in a
local elevation minimum. With increasing <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W\)</span> more potential targets are
considered, e.g. 16 for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W\)</span> = 2, 25 for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W\)</span> = 3, …</p>
<p>An important note is that the routing will always
jump to the closest river in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W\)</span> if a river pixel is present in the
window <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W\)</span>. This window <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(W\)</span> can be defined in the ini-file with the
<a class="reference internal" href="input.html#maxkernel"><span class="std std-ref">kernel - variable</span></a>.</p>
<p>In the flow chart, three features of the source pixel and the two target pixels
are accounted for to define a rule-bank for the routing direction: the elevation,
the land cover code and the presence of grass strips. First, the elevation of the target pixels
is examined in relation to the source pixel’s elevation. In case one of the
target pixels is located at a higher elevation, the flow will be defined towards the other target
based on the land cover code and presence of grass strips.</p>
<p>If the elevation of both target pixels is lower, the land cover code of the targets is
checked. If they both have a different land cover code than that of the source, the
<cite>find_lower</cite>-function is called. Additionally, if one or both have a different land cover
code, it is checked whether the pixel(s) is/are (a) grass strip(s): in
this case the flow direction will always be defined by the grass strips.</p>
<p>The implementation of this rule-bank aims to satisfy following conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>The routing should generally follow the height profile.</p></li>
<li><p>Routing within one agricultural parcel will remain in the parcel until
the lowest point of the parcel is reached. Thus, the routing will follow the
height profile in the direction of parcel boundaries rather than the
steepest descent.</p></li>
<li><p>Routing should target grass strips as a priority target. An exception
is defined if the two target pixels and the source pixel all have different
land cover codes (with one target pixel being a grass strip), and the target
grass strip being higher than the other target: here the routing follows the
direction of to the lowest pixel.</p></li>
<li><p>Pixels next to a river always route to a river (unless an extension is
used, see <a class="reference internal" href="routing-extension.html#routing-extensions"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>)</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="upstream-area-calculation">
<span id="upstreamarea"></span><h2>Upstream area calculation<a class="headerlink" href="#upstream-area-calculation" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Once the routing is known, the upstream area for all pixels is calculated. A
distinction is made between the <em>influx</em> and the <em>upstream area</em> for a pixel.
The influx is defined as area of all pixels flowing into the considered
pixel, not considering the contribution of the considered pixel itself to the
area. The upstream area for a pixel is defined as the area of all pixels
flowing into the considered pixel, including the area of considered pixel:</p>

considered as source pixel in case they directly route to the target pixel.</p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The influx is defined as zero for all pixels that do not receive any flux from
upstream pixels. These pixels are the first pixels treated in the WaTEM/SEDEM routing
scheme. Their upstream area is equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a \cdot (1-PTEF)\)</span>. The PTEF is
defined by the user for <a class="reference internal" href="input.html#parceltrapppingcrop"><span class="std std-ref">cropland</span></a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="input.html#parceltrappingpasture"><span class="std std-ref">pasture</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="input.html#parceltrappingforest"><span class="std std-ref">forest</span></a>.</p>
<p>Once the upstream area of a pixel is known, the <em>outflux</em>, or distribution
of the upstream area to its target pixels, is calculated. By default this
outflux is equal to the upstream area of the source pixel itself.
Adjustments to this outflux can be done in case of using extensions (see
<a class="reference internal" href="routing-extension.html#upstreamarea-extentions"><span class="std std-ref">here</span></a>)</p>
