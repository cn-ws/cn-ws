The CN-WS model is a composite model simulating the hydrological and
sediment mass balance for a given area. The aim of this page is to
give a full overview of the possible model inputs, outputs and choices.
It is important to indicate that CN-WS is a raster-based model. Thus, inputs
and outputs are mainly defined by this raster-format (idrisi). In addition,
a number of text-files are defined to define additional inputs and model
choices. Finally, it is noted that a lot of inputs, outputs and options are
available. For a first introduction to the use of these inputs, outputs and
choices, one is referred to the tutorial (:ref:`click here <tutorial>`).
