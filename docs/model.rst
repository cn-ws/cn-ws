The relevant parts of WaTEM/SEDEM to get started with the model are described in the
subsequent chapters. The purpose of this description is to give an introduction to the
operating equations within the model as well as the necessary parameter inputs and their
units.

.. note::
    The Curve Number model within CN-WS can be used as an extension to
    WaTEM/SEDEM.
