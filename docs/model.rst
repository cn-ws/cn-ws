Model Description
#################

CN-WS consists of three major parts. A routing algorithm and
two models: WaTEM/SEDEM (WS) and the Curve Number model (CN). 

These parts are described in the subsequent chapters. The chapter CN-WS describes the
combination of the three parts and is followed by an overview of the formulas
and units.

.. note::
    The Curve Number model within CN-WS can be used as an extension to
    WaTEM/SEDEM.
