Routing
#######

The flow and sediment routing is based on a multiple flow direction
algorithm implemented on a fixed grid. Specifically, the algorithm
makes use of the height profile and definition of land cover to define flow
from a source pixel to one or two target pixels. It is important to note
that the multi-flow routing algorithm developed for CN-WS is an algorithm
adjusted to the context of erosion and agriculture. This implies that the
routing should represent the average pattern of routing. This way, off-site
impacts (e.g. effect of erosion on an agricultural field on nearby urban
area) can be adequately be represented

The flow routing varies a function of the difference in height between
source and potential target pixels, and the land cover in the source and
targets. The land cover is defined in following table (see also :ref:`here
<prcmap>`). The codes listed in this table are used to define the routing in
CN-WS. In a first step, we make a distinction between the land cover of
(a) target(s) being equal to the class `river` (-1) (yes/no). Do note that in
this manual the non-river pixels are sometimes referred to as `land pixels`.

.. note::
    1. Routing flows from land to land pixels, land to river pixels, from river
    to river pixels, but not from river to land pixels!

    2. Routing can be defined in rivers, dams and ditches. Yet,
    this routing should be user-defined. We refer to separate sections for the
    defintion of routing in :ref:`rivers <riverrouting>`, :ref:`ditches <ditchmap>`
    and :ref:`dams <dammap>`.

    3. Note that **eight neighbours** are defined as **adjacent pixels** (and not
    only cardinal four).


Flow scheme of the routing algorithm
====================================

In this section we will describe the routing algorithm in depth, with several
flow charts as an illustration.

The first step of the routing algorithm is to sort all pixels in the raster from
high to low, based on the :ref:`digital elevation model <dtmmap>`. Next, the
algorithm loops over all pixels, starting from the highest pixel.
If the landcover of a pixel has a value of 0, it is skipped and no routing
is calculated for this pixel.
If the pixel is a river pixel and the river routing option is enabled
(see :ref:`here <riverrouting>`), the algorithm will use the user-defined
routing in the rivers. If the pixel is a river pixel and the river routing is
not enabled, than no river routing is calculated. If the pixel is not a river
pixel (land pixel), the default routing algorithm is used.
If the user enables the :ref:`Forced Routing <forcerouting>-option` in the
ini-file, the calculation of the routing by the default routing algorithm is
altered by the user-defined routing. Thus, this user-defined routing will
overrule the rulebank of the routing algorithm.

Default routing algorithm
*************************

The default routing algorithm is used for every pixel in the model except for
river pixels (if the :ref:`river routing option <riverrouting>` is enabled) and
for pixels outside the model domain (i.e. where the landuse has value 0).

In the first part of the routing algorithm it is checked if the routing of a
considered pixel is determined by a buffer, ditch or dam or if the pixel is
adjacent to a river, ditch or dam. This part of the algorithm is illustrated in
the figure below. It can be seen in this diagram that if the pixel is a ditch,
dam or adjacent to a ditch, dam or river than there is only one target pixel.

    :align: center

    Flow-chart of the routing algorithm in CN-WS describing first steps in the
    algorithm. Note that eight adjacent are taken into account.

We refer to the :ref:`section on routing maps <routingmap>` for a complete
description on target selection for ditches and dams.

If the source pixel is a buffer pixel than two cases are defined:

    1. The considered pixel has a buffer_id. This is the outlet pixel of the
       buffer. The default routing algorithm is used on this pixel.

    2. The considered pixel has a buffer extenstion-id. In this case there is
       only one target: the pixel within the buffer with the buffer_id (the
       outlet of the buffer).

If the routing is not determined by a buffer, ditch, dam or a river, the
routing algorithm checks whether the flow direction is
steered by the steepest descent direction or the **tillage direction** (for the
format of the input of the tillage direction, see :ref:`here <tildirmap>`).
In this check, the angle of the **steepest descend** is compared with the
tillage direction to define the routing (see Takken et al. (2001)). At the end
of this step, the direction is mapped to the (inter-) cardinal directions.
These cardinal directions define the `target1` and `target2` pixels, and the
weight (:math:`\in[0,1], \sum \text{weight} = 1`) they receive from the
source pixel. This amount can be used to weight the sediment load per
pixel (WS), the direct run-off depth (CN) and upstream area (CN/WS) for each
target pixel.

In the next step, the flow directions and weights (cardinal space)
are adjusted according to elevation and land cover, as shown in the scheme
below:

    :align: center

    to elevation and land cover. Note that eight adjacent are taken into
    account.

In this figure, the `Flow(target1)` or `Flow(target2)` tag indicate that
routing will follow strictly the path of the first or second cardinal flow
direction. In these cases, the flow is uni-directional, instead of
two-directional. The `find_lower` tag indicates that the algorithm will
search for the lowest neighbouring pixel (single target). A `jump` indicates
the target is not a neighbouring pixel of the source: the routing jumps
to a single target further than its vicinity. Jumps are defined
within a window :math:`W`. This occurs when a source is located in a local
elevation minimum. An important note is that the routing will always jump to
the closest river in :math:`W` if a river pixel is present in the window
:math:`W`. This window :math:`W` can be defined in the ini-file with the
:ref:`kernel - variable <maxkernel>`.

In the sketch, three features of the source pixel and two target pixels are accounted
for to define a rule-bank for the routing direction: the height, the land cover
code and presence of grass strips. First, it is checked whether
the targets are higher or lower than the source pixel. In case one of the
target pixels is higher, than the flow will be defined by the other target
based on the land cover code and presence of grass strips.

If both target pixels are lower, the land-use code of both targets is
checked. If both are different to the land-use code of the source, the
find_lower function is called. If one or both have a different land-use
code, it is checked whether the pixels is (are) (a) grass strip(s): in
this case the flow direction will always be defined by the grass strips.

The implementation of this rule-bank aims to satisfy following conditions:

 - The routing should generally follow the height profile.

 - Routing within one agricultural parcel will remain in the parcel until
   the lowest point of the parcel is reached. Thus, the routing will follow the
   height profile in the direction of parcel boundaries rather than the
   steepest descent.

 - Routing should target grass strips as a priority target. An exception
   is defined if the two target pixels and the source pixel all have different
   land cover codes (with one target pixel being a grass strip), and the target
   grass strip being higher than the other target: here the routing follows the
   direction of to the lowest pixel.
