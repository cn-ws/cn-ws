Routing
#######

The flow and sediment routing is based on a multiple flow direction
algorithm implemented on a fixed grid. Specifically, the algorithm
makes use of the height profile and definition of land cover to define flow
from a source pixel to one or two target pixels. It is important to note
that the multi-flow routing algorithm developed for CN-WS is an algorithm
adjusted to the context of erosion and agriculture.

The flow routing varies a function of the difference in height between
source and **potential** target pixels, and the **land cover** in the source
and targets. The land cover is defined in following table (see also :ref:`here
<prcmap>`). The codes listed in this table are used to define the routing in
CN-WS. A distinction is made between the land cover of (a) target(s) being
equal to the class `river` (-1) and not being equal to the class `river`
(non-river pixels). Do note that in this manual the non-river pixels are
sometimes referred to as `land pixels`.

.. note::
    1. Routing flows from land to land pixels, land to river pixels, river
    to river pixels, but not from river to land pixels!

    2. Routing can be defined in rivers, conductive buffer dams and conductive
    ditches, see in the section :ref:`below <riverrouting_exp>`. Do note that
    the **conductive**  is only used in the context of routing.

    3. Note that the **eight neighbouring pixels** are defined as
    **adjacent pixels** (and not only the four cardinal pixels), see also
    :ref:`the definition of the flow routing <routingmap>`.

    4. A **buffer** is not the same as a **conductive buffer dam** as
    **buffers** are defined as a measure with an trapping efficiency, whereas
    **conductive buffer dams** are defined by routing paths. As such, it is
    up to the user to define a buffer measure as a **buffer** (with a trapping
    efficiency) (1) or a **conductive buffer dam** (with a routing).


Flow scheme of the routing algorithm
====================================

In this section we will describe the routing algorithm in depth, with several
flow charts as an illustration.

The first step of the routing algorithm is to sort all pixels in the raster from
high to low, based on the :ref:`digital elevation model <dtmmap>`. In the
next step, the algorithm loops over all pixels, starting from the highest
pixel:

 - If the pixel is a **land pixel**, the default routing algorithm is used. If
   the user enables the :ref:`Forced Routing <forcerouting>-option` in the
   ini-file, the calculation of the routing by the default routing algorithm
   is altered by the user-defined routing. Thus, this user-defined routing
   will overrule the rulebank of the routing algorithm.
 - If the pixel is a **river pixel** and the river routing option is enabled
   (see :ref:`here <riverrouting>`), the algorithm will use the user-defined
   routing in the rivers. If the pixel is a river pixel and the river routing
   is not enabled, than no river routing is calculated.
 - If the landcover of a pixel has a value of 0, it is skipped and no routing
   is calculated for this pixel.


Default routing algorithm
*************************

The default routing algorithm is used for every pixel in the model except for
river pixels (landuse value -1, if the
:ref:`river routing option <riverrouting>` is enabled) and
for pixels outside the model domain (i.e. where the landuse has value 0).

It is important to note that the routing is defined by

In the first part of the routing algorithm it is checked if the routing of a
considered pixel is determined by a **buffer**, **conductive ditch** or
**conductive buffer dam** or if the pixel is adjacent to a river, conductive
ditch or conductive buffer dam. This part of the algorithm is illustrated in
the figure below. There is only one target pixel in case that a pixel is a
conductive ditch, conductive buffer dam or adjacent to a conductive ditch,
conductive buffer dam or river.

    Flow-chart of the routing algorithm in CN-WS describing the first steps in
    the algorithm. Note that eight adjacent pixels are taken into account.

If the source pixel is a buffer pixel than two cases are defined:

    1. The considered pixel has a buffer_id. This is the outlet pixel of the
       buffer. The default routing algorithm is used in this pixel.

    2. The considered pixel has a buffer extension-id. In this case there is
       only one target pixel: the pixel within the buffer with the buffer_id
       (i.e. the outlet of the buffer).

We refer to the :ref:`section on buffers <includebuffers>` for a complete
description of how buffers are defined. For description on the definition of
conductive buffer dams and conductive ditches, we refer to the section on
:ref:`river routing <riverrouting_exp>`.

If the routing is not determined by a buffer, conductive ditch, conductive
buffer dam or a river, the routing algorithm checks whether the flow direction
is steered by the steepest descent direction or the **tillage direction** (for
the format of the input of the tillage direction, see :ref:`here <tildirmap>`).
In this check, the angle of the **steepest descend** is compared with the
tillage direction to define the routing (see Takken et al. (2001)). At the end
of this step, the direction is mapped to the (inter-) cardinal directions.
These cardinal directions define the `target1` and `target2` pixels, and the
weight (:math:`\in[0,1], \sum \text{weight} = 1`) they receive from the
source pixel. This amount can be used to weigh the sediment load per
pixel (WS), the direct run-off depth (CN) and upstream area (CN/WS) for each
target pixel.

In the next step, the flow directions and weights (cardinal space)
are adjusted according to elevation and land cover, as shown in the scheme
below:

    :align: center

    Flow-chart of the routing algorithm in CN-WS - adjusting routing according
    to elevation and land cover. Note that eight adjacent are taken into
    account.

In this figure, the `Flow(target1)` or `Flow(target2)` tag indicate that
routing will follow strictly the path of the first or second cardinal flow
direction. In these cases, the flow is uni-directional, instead of
two-directional. The `find_lower` tag indicates that the algorithm will
search for the lowest neighbouring pixel (single target). A `jump` indicates
the target is not a neighbouring pixel of the source: the routing jumps
to a single target further than its vicinity. Jumps are defined
within a window :math:`W`. This occurs when a source is located in a local
elevation minimum. An important note is that the routing will always jump to
the closest river in :math:`W` if a river pixel is present in the window
:math:`W`. This window :math:`W` can be defined in the ini-file with the
:ref:`kernel - variable <maxkernel>`.

In the sketch, three features of the source pixel and two target pixels are accounted
for to define a rule-bank for the routing direction: the height, the land cover
code and presence of grass strips. First, it is checked whether
the targets are higher or lower than the source pixel. In case one of the
target pixels is higher, than the flow will be defined by the other target
based on the land cover code and presence of grass strips.

If both target pixels are lower, the land-use code of both targets is
checked. If both are different to the land-use code of the source, the
find_lower function is called. If one or both have a different land-use
code, it is checked whether the pixels is (are) (a) grass strip(s): in
this case the flow direction will always be defined by the grass strips.

The implementation of this rule-bank aims to satisfy following conditions:

 - The routing should generally follow the height profile.

 - Routing within one agricultural parcel will remain in the parcel until
   the lowest point of the parcel is reached. Thus, the routing will follow the
   height profile in the direction of parcel boundaries rather than the
   steepest descent.

 - Routing should target grass strips as a priority target. An exception
   is defined if the two target pixels and the source pixel all have different
   land cover codes (with one target pixel being a grass strip), and the target
   grass strip being higher than the other target: here the routing follows the
   direction of to the lowest pixel.

Forced routing
**************
**Forced routing** is typically used to force a routing vector from a specific
source to a target pixel, in case of a local suboptimal routing pattern.
Forced routing is user-defined. The instructions for defining forced routing
are found `here <forcedroutingdata>`.

.. _riverrouting_exp:

River routing
**************
**River routing** is defined by making use of
:ref:`routing maps <routingmap>`. In addition, these map can be used to define
routing in **conductive buffer dams** and **conductive ditches**. We refer to
separate sections for the definition of routing in
:ref:`rivers <riverrouting>`, :ref:`ditches <ditchmap>` and
:ref:`dams <dammap>`. The workflow on how to create these rasters is described
in the section on :ref:`routing maps <routingmap>`.
