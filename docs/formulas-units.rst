Overview of formula's and units
###############################

The aim of this page is to give an overview of the formula's and the units used
in CN-WS. The motivation to this is to make a distinction between the units
used in the :ref:`model description<modeldescription>`,
:ref:`model description<modelinput>`, model states and
:ref:`model outputs<modeloutput>`. This overview can help interpret the outputs
of CN-WS.

.. note::
    This page is under construction. For now, the formula and units analysis
    has only been done for WS.
