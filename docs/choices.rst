Model choices
#############

Most model choices are boolean options and are enabled in the .ini-file with "1"
and disabled with "0". Some options expect a string value. The possible strings
are described together with the modeloption.

.. _lmodel:

L model
#######

CN-WS allows the user to choose between two models to calculate the
:ref:`L-factor <lsfactor>`. The L-factor defines the impact of the slope length
and is used in the calculation of :ref:`RUSLE <rusle>` and
:ref:`transport capacity (TC) <TC>`.

The L-model is calculated according to the work of Desmet and Govers (1996):

.. math::
    L = \frac{(A+D^2)^{m+1}-A^{m+1}}{D^{m+2}.x^m.22,13^m}

with
 - :math:`A`: upstream area for every raster pixel (:math:`\text{m}^2`).
 - :math:`D`: grid resolution (m).
 - :math:`m`: length exponent (-).
 - :math:`x`: factor incorporating the flow direction (-).

:math:`x` is calculated as a function of the aspect :math:`\alpha` of the pixel:

.. math::
    x = |sin(\alpha)| + |cos(\alpha)|

The upstream area :math:`A` in a pixel is determined by the stream flow
algorithm, by considering a parcel trapping efficiency and the parcel
connectivity.

For the computation of :math:`m` two options exist:

**Van Oost et al. 2003:**

Van Oost et al. (2003) uses a different :math:`m` depending on the surface of
the upstream area :math:`A`. If the upstream area is smaller than
:math:`A_{ref}` = 10.000 ha, :math:`m` is calculated as

.. math::
    m = 0.3 + (\frac{A}{A_{ref}})^c

otherwise :math:`m` is set to 0.72.

The calculation method of Van Oost et al. (2003) can be chosen by setting
the model choice *L model* to 'Desmet1996_Vanoost'. This is the default value
for this model option.

**McCool et al. (1989):**

McCool et al. (1989) calculate :math:`m` as:

.. math::
    m = \frac{\beta}{\beta + 1}

with :math:`\beta` calculated as

.. math::
    \beta = \frac{\frac{sin(\theta)}{0.0896}}{3.sin^{0.8}(\theta) + 0.56}

with :math:`\theta` the slope of the pixel in percentages.

The calculation method of McCool et al. (1989, 1987) can be chosen by setting
the model choice *L model* to 'Desmet1996_McCool'.

.. _smodel:

S model
#######

CN-WS allows the user to choose between two models to calculate the
:ref:`S-factor <lsfactor>`. The S-factor defines the effect of slope steepness
and is used in the calculation of :ref:`RUSLE <rusle>` and
:ref:`transport capacity (TC) <TC>`.

Both models are a function of :math:`\theta`: the inclination angle or slope
(%). The computation of the inclincation angle is based on the four cardinal
neighbouring pixels (Zevenbergen and Thorne, 1987).

The two S-models are:

**Nearing (1997)**:

.. math::
    S = -1,5+\frac{17}{1+e^{2,3-6.1.\sin{\theta}}}

The method of Nearing (1997) can be activated in CNWS by setting
*S model* to 'Nearing1997'. This is the default method to calculate the S factor.

**McCool et al. (1987)**

McCool et al. (1987) distinguish two cases:

.. math::
    S = (10.8.sin(\theta)) + 0.03

is valid when:

.. math::
    100.arctan(\theta) < 9.0

otherwise, S is calculated as:

.. math::
    S = (16.8.sin(\theta)) - 0.5

The method of McCool et al. (1987) can be activated in CNWS by setting
*S model* to 'McCool1987'.

.. _tcmodel:

TC Model
########

The Transport Capacity (TC) can be calculated in two ways in CN-WS. The default
method is the method proposed by Van Oost et al. (2000):

.. math::
    TC = kTC.R.K.(LS - 4.12.S_g^{0.8})

with

- :math:`kTC`: transport capacity coeffient (m)
- :math:`R`: :ref:`rain fall erosivity <rfactor>`
- :math:`K`: :ref:`soil erobility factor <kfactor>`
- :math:`LS`: :ref:`slope length and slope steepness factor <lsfactor>`
- :math:`S_g`: local slope (:math:`\frac{\text{m}}{\text{m}}`)

Most studies using WaTEM-SEDEM use the method of Van Oost et al. (2000).
However, a second method, proposed by Verstraeten et al. (2007), also exists:

.. math::
    TC = kTC.R.K.A^{1.4}.S_g^{1.4}

with

- :math:`A`: the upstream area (mÂ²) of the pixel

A detailed description and comparison of both TC models can be found in
Verstraeten et al. (2007).

The method of Verstraeten et al. (2007) can be activated in CNWS by setting
*TC model* to 'Verstraeten2007'. The method of Van Oost et al. (2000) is
activated by setting *TC model* to 'VanOost2000', this is the default value.

Only Routing
############

By enabling the Only Routing option, only the routing will be determined by
CN-WS. No sediment calculations or discharge calculations are done:
the WaTEM-SEDEM and CN modules are disabled. When using this option only
:ref:`a limited model output <onlyroutingoutput>` is possible.

This option is usefull in large catchments to evaluate the routing without
calculating the sediment transport or discharges.

.. _simple:

Simple
######

When the option 'Simple' is enabled, only WaTEM-SEDEM is used and the CN-model
is disabled. By disabling Simple, you will use the full the CN-WS model.

.. _calctileros:

Calculate tillage erosion
#########################

TO DO

.. _createktil:

Create ktil map
###############

CN-WS is able to create a raster with ktil-factors. The ktil value is the
transport capacity coeficient for tillage erosion. When `Creat ktil map = 1`,
the model expects two input variables: :ref:`ktil default <ktildefault>` and
:ref:`ktil threshold <ktilthres>`. The C-factor map will be reclassed by these
values: C-factors higher than ktil threshold will get the value of ktil default,
other pixels are set to zero. When `Create ktil map = 0` the user will have to
make a ktil map himself. The model will expect the filename of this ktil map
in :ref:`ktil map filename <ktilmap>`.

.. _createktc:

Create ktc map
##############

CN-WS is able to create a raster with ktc-factors for high erodible and
non-erodible land-use. When `Create ktc map = 1` the model expects three
variables: :ref:`ktc low <ktclow>`, :ref:`ktc high <ktchigh>`,
:ref:`ktc limit <ktclimit>`. The C-factor map will be reclassed by these values:
C-factors higher than ktc limit will get the value of ktc high, otherwise ktc
low is chosen.

When `Create ktc map = 0` the user will have to make a ktc map himself. The
model will expect the filename of this ktc map in
:ref:`ktc map filename <ktcmap>`.

.. _inlcudesewers:

Include sewers
##############

When the include sewers-option is enabled, the user will have to provide two
additional inputs: `sewer map filename` and `sewer exit`.

The value of the pixel in the sewer map is checked when the amount of outgoing
sediment in a pixel is calculated. This value is the fraction of water and
sediment that is trapped in the sewer system via this pixel. The outgoing
sediment of the pixel is reduced with this fraction. The amount of trapped
sediment is written to output raster sewer_in.rst.

.. note::
    This option is fully tested for :ref:`simple=1`, but it is not yet tested
    for the full CN-WS model.

.. _includebuffers:

Include buffers
###############

An infrastructural measure that traps an amount of transported sediment is
called a buffer. These measures can be simulated in the model by enabling
the Include buffers option. By enabling this option the `buffer map filename`
becomes mandatory in the ini-file. Next to this raster, the ini-file must
contain the variable `number of buffers` and a seperate section for every buffer
in the buffer map. In every buffer section in the ini-file some variables must
be given.

The Include buffers option adjusts the routing in the pixels. All pixels within
a buffer with the buffer :ref:`extension id <extension_id>` are routed to the
outletpixel of the buffer. This outletpixel in the bufferraster is marked with
the buffer id. The amount of sediment that flows out of the bufferoutlet is
reduced with the :ref:`trapping efficiency <PTEFBuffer>` of the buffer.

.. _includeditches:

Include ditches
###############

Ditches alter the routing. The sediment and water will follow the course of a
ditch in stead of along the steepest slope. When this option is enabled,
:ref:`a raster with information about the direction <ditchmap>` is mandatory.

The model sets the C-factor at every ditch pixel tot 0.01. Thus, it overwrites
the value of the pixel in the :ref:`C-factor raster <cmap> `.
The ktc value of the pixel is set to :ref:`ktc low <ktclow>`.

.. _includedams:

Include dams
############

Dams alter the routing in the same way as ditches. The sediment and water will
follow the course of a dam in stead of along the steepest slope. When this
option is enabled, :ref:`a raster with information about the direction <dammap>`
is mandatory.

The model sets the C-factor at every dam pixel to 0. Thus, it overwrites
the value of the pixel in the :ref:`C-factor raster <cmap> `.
The ktc value of the pixel is set to -9999.

Force Routing
#############

When the routing based on the built-in rules of the model is not correct (e.g.
in the neighbourhood of infrastructure) the user has the possibility to impose
the routing. This is done by enabling the Force Routing option. With force
routing the routing algorithm will use the routing imposed by the user instead
of the digital elevation model.

When `Force Routing = 1` the user will have to provide additional input: the
variable `number of force routing` and a seperate section for every routing
vector the user wants to add. `Number of force routing` contains an integer
value with the amount of routing vectors that are imposed by the user.

An example of a valid forced routing section looks like

.. code-block:: ini

    [Force routing 1]
    from col = 25
    from row = 55
    target col = 30
    target row = 55


The keys in every force routing section are `from col`, `from row`, `target col`
and `target row`. These are integer values representing the location of source
and target pixel
in the raster.

.. _riverrouting:

River Routing
#############

By enabling the river routing option, the routing between river pixels is
imposed by an input raster and two input tables.
This option is usefull because the calculated routing in a river, based on the
digital elevation model, is not always correct.

Following input-files are required when `River Routing = 1`:

* :ref:`river segment file <riversegmentfile>`
* :ref:`river routing file <riverroutingmap>`
* :ref:`adjectant segments file <adjsegments>`
* :ref:`upstream segments file <upstrsegments>`

When this option is disabled, the model will use the digital elevation model to
determine the routing between all river pixels.

Include tillage direction
#########################

This option alters the routing on agricultural fields. When this option is
enabled, the routing will follow the tillage direction on these fields.

Following input-files are required when `Include tillage direction = 1`:

* :ref:`tillage direction map <tildirmap>`
* :ref:`oriented roughness map <orientedroughnessmap>`

.. note::
    This option is not yet tested.

Adjusted Slope
##############

Normally, the slope of a pixel is determined by the algoritm of Zevenbergen and
Thorne (1987) on the four neighbouring, cardinal cells.
This procedure works good in areas where the routing is solely based on on the
digital elevation model. In areas where the routing is imposed by other rules
(e.g. at parcel boundaries, in buffers,...) the slope of the direction in the
routing can be different than the calculated slope by Zevenbergen and
Thorne (1987). In these cases the slope can be calculated by dividing the
absolute value of the height difference between the source and target pixel,
with the distance between these two pixels. This calculation is enabled by
setting `Adjusted Slope = 1`

.. _estimclay:

Estimate Clay content
#####################

When using the full CN-WS model (i.e. :ref:`simple=0 <simple>`), it is possible
to estimate the clay content at every outlet and in every river
segment (the latter only when :ref:`output per river segment <outputsegment>`
is enabled). To do this, the user needs to define the
:ref:`clay content of the parent material <claycontent>`
(:math:`CC_{text{parent}}`).

First, the enrichment factor :math:`EF` for clay is calculated:

.. math::
    EF = 1 + 0.7732.\exp^{-0.0508.SC}

where :math:`SC` is the sediment concentration (g/l).

The estimated clay content :math:`CC` (%) for an outlet or segment is calculated
as a function of :math:`EF` and :math:`CC_{text{parent}}`:

.. math::
    CC = CC_{parent}.EF

After the calculation, following files are written:

* :ref:`Clay content sediment.txt <claycontentesedtxt>`
* :ref:`Clay content sediment segments.txt <claycontentesedsegmenttxt>`

.. note::
    This option is not yet tested.

.. _calibrate:

Calibrate
#########

The Calibrate-option allows the model user to run the model with a given set of
options, variables and inputfiles for a number of combinations of ktc-factors.
Both the ktc_high-factor as the ktc_low-factor are varied in an amount of steps
between a lower and upper value. For every combination of ktc-factors where
ktc_high > ktc_low, the model will make a calculation and write the results to a
:ref:`Calibration file <calibrationtxt>`.
A more detailed explaination about how and why to calibrate can ben found
:ref:`here <calibration>`

.. _outputsegment:

Output per river segment
########################

A river segment is defined as a series of consequent river pixels. Mostly, a
segment starts at a confluence of different rivers and it stops at the next
confluence. CN-WS has the option to make a summary of the results per river
segment. For every segment the total sedimentinput, total discharge or the
sediment concentration is calculated.

River segments are defined in a :ref:`separate raster <riversegmentfile>`. This
raster is mandatory when this option is enabled.

When this option is enabled, following output is written:

- :ref:`Total Sediment segments.txt <totalsedimentsegmenttxt>`
- :ref:`Cumulative sediment segments.txt <cumsedsegmenttxt>`
- :ref:`Discharge_segments.txt <dischargesegment>`
- :ref:`Sediment concentration segments.txt <sedconcensegment>`
- :ref:`Sediment_segments.txt <sedsegmenttxt>`

**Note:** The CN-WS model was further optimized from 2016 to define river
segments in the context of of Flanders water management. Therefore, the
segments in CN-WS for Flanders are defined by the `Vlaams Hydrologische Atlas`
(VHA).


.. _manualoutlet:

Manual outlet selection
#######################

By default, the model will determine the outlet pixel as the lowest (river)
pixel within the model domain. However, by setting `Manual outlet selection = 1`,
the model expects an :ref:`outlet raster <outletmap>`: an integer raster where
the outletpixels are numbered from 1 to n. The user has to provide this input
file.

.. _useR:

use r factor
############

WaTEM-SEDEM requires an :ref:`R-factor <rfactor>` for the RUSLE calculation.
When `Use R factor = 1`, the user will have to define the
:ref:`R factor <rfactor_var>` himself.

CN-WS is able to calculate an R-factor from a timeseries of rainfall data.
This R-factor represents the erosivity of the rainfall event that is simulated
by the model. To use this option, the user has to set `Use R factor = 0` and
must define the :ref:`rainfall file <rainfallfile>`.

(TO DO: add information about how R-factor is calculated?)

The user has the option to generate extra output by defining following keys in
the [Output maps]-section of the .ini-file.
