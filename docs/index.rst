This documentation describes the background and the use of the CN-WS model.

For who is this documentation?
==============================

This page aims to explain how the CN-WS model can be run for a given case
study, and which output can be analysed to study the specific case. In
addition, it aims to explain how a specific run for case study can be set-up
(i.e. which input data are needed? in which format?). Finally, this page is
the location for background information on model concepts, options, inputs
and outputs. In order to this, this set of minimal skills is required:

- Basic command line skills (know how to open your command line, and run an
  executable).
- Opening text files in a text editor.
- Opening raster data in QGIS, ArcGIS or your favorite GIS program.
