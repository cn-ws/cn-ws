Errors in the command line interface
====================================

Errors detected during execution are called **exceptions** and are causing the model 
to stop. The last line of the error message indicates what happened.
The parser repeats the offending section and displays a little ‘arrow’ pointing at 
the earliest point in the line where the error was detected.
