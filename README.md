# WaTEM/SEDEM

WaTEM/SEDEM is a soil erosion and sediment delivery model used for catchment-scale
simulations. The model incorporates a Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE)
module to simulate gross erosion, extended with a spatially-explicit sediment routing
module to simulate sediment transport based on a cellular transport capacity. The model
therefore provides the user with predictions of gross and net soil erosion at the
catchment scale.

WaTEM/SEDEM has been applied for numerous applications considering both the on-site and
off-site impacts of soil erosion. These applications include the predicted soil loss
from fields, off-site deposition, predictions of catchment sediment yield. The model has
also been extended for the simulation of transported heavy metals, nutrients and organic
carbon. The default application of the model can be extended in several ways to simulate
the impact of soil erosion mitigation measures in a spatially-explicit way. For example,
additional options within the model allow for the consideration of other anthropogenic
factors such as roads, sewage systems, water and sediment buffer basins, dams and
ditches.

## Code

The code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/watem-sedem/watem-sedem/). 
Binaries for windows or linux of the releases can be 
[downloaded](https://github.com/watem-sedem/watem-sedem/releases) too. 

## Documentation

The extensive documentation can be found on the 
[watem-sedem documentation page](https://watem-sedem.github.io/watem-sedem/). 
In this documentation, a theoretical background of the model and an overview
of the model usage are given, as well as an installation guide followed by a
[tutorial](https://watem-sedem.github.io/watem-sedem/tutorial.html).

## Get started

The fastest way to start modelling is to 
[download](https://github.com/watem-sedem/watem-sedem/releases) the binary of the 
most recent release and follow the 
[installation instructions](https://watem-sedem.github.io/watem-sedem/installation.html) in 
the documentation. A [tutorial](https://watem-sedem.github.io/watem-sedem/tutorial.html) is 
also available.
