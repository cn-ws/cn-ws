# CN-WS

CN-WS is a model that can be used to
simulate soil erosion, sediment transport, water and sediment routing and
flow run-off in time and space. The package combines three existing submodels:

 - The Curve Number model (CN) for simulating flow run-off.
 - The WaTEM/SEDEM model (WS) for simulating erosion and over-land sediment
   transport.
 - The routing algorithm for simulating water and sediment routing over land.

CN-WS is developed to assess soil erosion on
agricultural fields, sediment transport through the landscape and sediment
delivery to watercourses and sewage systems. As the impact of soil erosion
mitigation measures is incorporated, the model can also be used to evaluate soil
erosion management measures and compare mitigation strategies.

## Code

The code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/cn-ws/cn-ws/). 
Binaries for windows or linux of the releases can be 
[downloaded](https://github.com/cn-ws/cn-ws/releases) too. 

## Documentation

The extensive documentation can be found on the 
[cn-ws documentation page](https://docs.fluves.net/cn_ws/index.html). 
In this documentation, a theoretical background of the model and an overview
of the model usage are given, as well as an installation guide followed by a
tutorial.

## Get started

The fastest way to start modelling is to download the binary of the 
most recent release and follow the 
[installation instructions](https://docs.fluves.net/cn_ws/installation.html) in 
the documentation. A [tutorial](https://docs.fluves.net/cn_ws/tutorial.html) is 
also available.
